# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions to some of the challenges of [AoC 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

## Usage

I had some time to kill in between challenges, so I created a command system to ease the process of solving and viewing challenges. This way, I can just create the challenge folder and code a solution, without having to type CLI commands or do the whole "import input" thing.

If you have VS Code, a launch configuration is provided for easy access to commands. Otherwise, boot up that CLI and run the following commands:

### Solve a challenge

Solves the challenge for a given `day` and `part`. Default `day` is the last day in the `days` folder and default `part` is the last part in the `day`'s folder.

```bash
npm start -- solve [--day=<day>] [--part=<part>]

# Examples
npm start solve --day=1 --part=1  # Solve day 1 part 1
npm start solve --day=1           # Solve day 1 last part
npm start solve --part=1          # Solve last day part 1
```

### View challenge info

Shows the challenge problem and answer, if available, for a given `day` and `part`. Default `day` is the last day in the `days` folder and default `part` is the last part in the `day`'s folder.

```bash
npm start -- info [--day=<day>] [--part=<part>]

# Examples
npm start info --day=1 --part=1  # Show info for day 1 part 1
npm start info --day=1           # Show info for day 1 last part
npm start info --part=1          # Show info for last day part 1
```

### Create a new challenge folder

Creates a new folder for a specified day. Default day is the last day in the `days` folder.
- If the day does not already exist, the first part will be created.
- If the day already exists, the next part will be created.

```bash
npm start -- create [--day=<day>]

# Examples
npm start create --day=1  # Create day 1 and part 1 folders
npm start create          # Create part-2 folder for day 1
```

## Challenge structure

In order for the `solve` command to work out of the box, this is the imposed structure:

* Each daily challenge is a folder in the `days` folder, identified by a single number (the day).
* Each daily challenge contains folders for each part of the challenge, identified by the name "part-<number>":
* Each part folder contains:
    - `challenge.txt`: the problem statement
    - `input.txt`: the input for the challenge
    - `index.ts`: the solution code
    - `answer.txt`: the answer for the challenge, if available. This file is generated by the `solve` command.
